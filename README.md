# Oditor
A simple text editor written in OCaml

Oditor is still a WIP and cannot be used in its actual state.

## Text editing

Oditor is a text editor written with Vim keybindings.
It also works around Normal, Command and Insert mode.

Arrows are not yet supported, so you don't have a choice but to use the bindings ;)

## Coming soon

- Autocompletion
- Tuareg mode
- Dune compilation tools
